# ASP.NET Core Repository Pattern with Data Projection

This repository showcases an ASP.NET Core application implementing the Repository Pattern with Data Projection using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and AutoMapper.

## Entities

### `IEntity` Interface (Optional)

Defines the common property `Id` for entities.

### `User` Entity

A sample entity representing a user with properties `Id`, `Username`, `Age`, and `IsActive`.

## Repositories

### `IUserRepository` Interface (Optional)

Extends the generic `IRepository` interface for additional methods specific to the `User` entity.

### `UserRepository` Implementation

Implements the `IUserRepository` interface and provides methods for database operations related to users.

## Unit of Work

### `IUnitOfWork` Interface

Defines methods for committing changes to the database and rolling back transactions.

### `UnitOfWork` Implementation

Implements the `IUnitOfWork` interface to manage database transactions.

## Repository Interface

### `IRepository` Interface

A generic interface defining methods for basic CRUD operations, filtering, paging, and data projection.

## Repository Implementation

### `Repository<T>` Class

Implements the generic `IRepository` interface for database operations on entities. It includes methods for data projection using AutoMapper.

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

### `UserDTO` Class

A Data Transfer Object representing a simplified view of the `User` entity.

## AutoMapper Configuration

### `AutoMapperConfig` Class

Configures AutoMapper to map between `User` entities and `UserDTO` objects.

## Sample Service

### `UserService` Class

A sample service class utilizing the repository for fetching active users and projecting them to DTOs.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Configure the database connection in `appsettings.json`.
- Run the application.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Dependency Injection:** Utilize a dependency injection framework for better testability and loose coupling.
- **Error Handling:** Expand error handling, implement recovery mechanisms, and handle data access issues in repositories.
- **Validation:** Incorporate validation logic in service methods.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Add logging and monitoring for proactive issue identification.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize queries and repository methods for efficiency.
- **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests for repositories and services.
- **Data Projection:** Explore options for returning projections of entities instead of full entities.
- **Async/Await Usage:** Ensure consistent use of async/await for asynchronous operations.
- **Null Reference Checks:** Add null reference checks in service methods.

Feel free to customize and extend this code for your specific requirements.
